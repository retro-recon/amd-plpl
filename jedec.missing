	Sorry,  no  jedec.shr.Z  -file.
I do not know if I ever had it either, since these files are from
1986 or so, and have travelled thru multiple systems (MSDOS/IBM mainframe/
UNIX/VMS/..)

Of course one can't create JEDEC files without this module, but
then there is a possibility to do simulations etc. in workstation
and move file into a PC for final compile.

At least that is what I have used to do..
